## TransitAR REST API

### Won Hackforge Hackathon: Best Overall Team

Tranist AR is an augmented-reality information solution for bus users. Simply point you smartphone camera at a bus-stop, and the app will pull of the relevant bus stop times and local attractions.

This is the backend API that was developed to push data to the AR app. The API parsed City of Windsor OpenData(csv), and uploaded it to an endpoint programmatically.
